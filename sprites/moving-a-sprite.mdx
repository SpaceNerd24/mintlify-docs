## Chose which of the 2 ways to move a Sprite you will use.

You can either use the `setPosition()` way which would look like this:

```javascript example.js
firstSprite.setPosition(100, 100);
```

You also can use the Translation method which would look like this:

```javascript example.js
firstSprite.translate(1, 1);
```

The `setPosition()` method moves the sprite to a position on the canvas while the `translate()` method
moves the sprite on the x axis by the fist value and the y axis by the second
