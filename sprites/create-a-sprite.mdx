## Create your Sprite Variable

First create your sprite variable by pasting this code into your `example.js` file:

```javascript example.js
const firstSprite = new Sprite()
```

Then add all the nessasary parameters into the sprite (Ex: Xpos and Ypos) by inputing the values
into the `firstSprite` variable.

```javascript example.js
"path-to-your-image", width, height, xpos, ypos, id
```

Once you are done with that your line should look something like this:

```javascript example.js
const firstSprite = new Sprite("path-to-your-image", width, height, xpos, ypos, id);
```

## Draw your Sprite to the canvas

To draw your newly created sprite onto the canvas you will need to go to your gameLoop which should look  something like this:

```javascript example.js 
function gameLoop() {
    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
    
    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);
}
```

You will draw your sprite in this functon, 
you should do that by adding this code between the `ctx.clearRect()` and `requestAnimationFrame()` parts.

```javascript example.js
firstSprite.draw(ctx);
```

Now if you view your `index.html` file in a browser it should show your sprite.
